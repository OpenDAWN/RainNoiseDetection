# RainNoiseDetection
Algorithm for automatically detecting Outdoor Rain-fall noise in soundscapes - specifically intended for data-filtering in bio-acoustics

This algorithm is designed to detect rain-fall noise in 10 s chunks, the resulting detection is then averaged over 5 minute periods.  The function is written in Matlab and the usage is as follows;

Installation
1) After cloning or downloading the git repro, run the matlab script 'install.m' which will add the required paths.
Usage
An example of the usage is presented in TestRainDet.m, if you run this script it will process the data from two example files of outdoor recordings, where initially there is no rain and then rain starts about 15 minutes into the recording, the recording consists of two wav files, which represent a contiguous recording.  The main function is contained in the script acousticRainDetection.m, the usage of this function is as follows:

The function assumes mono audio, and a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz.Although it will accept any sampling frequency, and resample to 44.1 kHz. Stereo files are summed over the channels to mono.
 fileNameCells is a cell array where each cell contains a string where the
   string is the path and filename of a wav file, the order of the files
   important, this enables processing of recordings consisting of multiple
   files,  
 startdate is a number in matlab datenum format represents the
   exact start time of the first recording, the files must be contiguous.
    
 The function description: 
 1) Audio is analysed in 10 sec, non overlapping chunks
 2) In each 10s chunk a selection of audio features are extracted
 3) from these features  Random forest has been trained to detect the
 presence of rain fall, the random forest was trained using the statistics
 toolbox, but a function has been provided to evaluate the forest without
 the toolbox (randForest)
 4) the function will output the class of each 10 s chunk (0= rain free,
 1= contains rain), which has been smoothed using a 5minute moving average
 window (30 10s chunks)
 5) the function utilises the parallel computing tool box if available and
 will automatically process Nc process simultaneously where Nc is the
 number of cores on the computer, the function extracts a numnber of wav
 files at each iteration so that the data is separately available for each
 core in the parfor loop.
